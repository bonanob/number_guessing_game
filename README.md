# Project 1: The Number Guessing Game

This is a console game where you guess a number between 1 and 10. The job is to make a guess, and players will get a message whether the guess is too high or too low. The next guess is based on the message. If they guess the right answer the game is done. Aim for the lowest number of tries possible!

**How to run the project locally:**

If you have python installed, just run the `guessing_game.py`

**What I've learned:**

- Creating a loop
- Conditional statements

**Objective:** 

Guess a number 1-10 with the lowest number of tries.

**Flow:**

1. Guess a number between 1 and 10.
2. After every answer, a message is shown whether the guess is too high or too low.
3. If the guess is right, the game is done.
4. Player are asked if they want to play again.

**Notes:**

- Player inputs are validated(An int 1-10)
- At the start of each game, the current high score (least amount of points) is shown, so that players know what they're supposed to beat.
